            <h1>Thanks For Everything</h1>
            <p>What would I do without your smart mouth?
              Drawing me in and you kicking me out
              You've got my head spinning, no kidding
              I can't pin you down
              What's going on in that beautiful mind
              I'm on your magical mystery ride
              And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
              But I'll be alright
              My head's under water
              But I'm breathing fine
              You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
              'Cause all of me
               Loves all of you
               Love your curves and all your edges
               All your perfect imperfections
               Give your all to me
               I'll give my all to you
               You're my end and my beginning
               Even when I lose I'm winning
               'Cause I give you all of me
               And you give me all of you, oh oh
               How many times do I have to tell you?
               Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
               The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
      </p>

          <p>You're my downfall, you're my muse
          My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
          I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you
          My head's under water
          But I'm breathing fine
          You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
          'Cause all of me
          Loves all of you
          Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
          Risking it all, though it's hard
          'Cause all of me
          Loves all of you
